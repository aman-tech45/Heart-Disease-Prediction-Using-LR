Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression  | ML Model


"Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression" is a focused machine learning project aimed at utilizing the logistic regression algorithm to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. This project involves analyzing various cardiovascular risk factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant parameters. By training a logistic regression model on a dataset containing both positive and negative instances of heart disease, the project seeks to create an accurate predictive tool. This application has the potential to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and risk assessment, ultimately contributing to proactive and targeted interventions for individuals at risk of heart disease".
